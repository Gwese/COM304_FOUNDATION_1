## session 6

Introduction to Operating Systems

In this session, I learnt about core concepts underlying **_Operating Systems._** These are system software that controls software and hardware resources of a computer. Popular operating systems quite common include MacOS, Microsoft Windows and Linux

**_Interrupts_** are specific signals designed to temporarily stop ongoing operations in a machine, in order to focus on a particular task. This enables CPU to focus on emergency situations effectively.

**_Scheduling_**

In addition, modern day machine look like they are multi tasking, yet the operating system is handling CPU. This allows its time to be shared among multiple processes, creating a “multi-tasking illusion “

Scheduler is a software component that controls executions in a machine or computer system. It reacts to system clock and interference.

**_Memory Management:_**

I learnt about how early computers had little Random Access Memory (RAM). This was costly however programs required a lot RAM in order to run, which became an issue, particularly commercial computing.

**Virtual Memory** was then introduced as a means to enable computers to continue operating as though it had unlimited amounts of RAM. As a result, there was no requirement for large capacities of actual RAM

**Kernel and User Processes;**

These are processes operating in kernel mode, directing them to link hardware and system resources. They are key components of an operating system’s kernel, also known as **kernel processes** because they are at the core of the system and operate with special privileges, which allows it to access memory in the system.

**Session 7**

In this session, we looked at the history of Linux Operating System. In the 1970s, AT&T introduced the original C programming language. They used that to write a new operating system named **_Unix._** As time went on. Unix and C became favourable to Manufacturers, which prompted them to develop their own variants. Hewlett Packard’s variant is HPUX

Solaris-Sun Microsystems

IBM- AIX

Digital Equipment Corporation-Ultrix

Linux is known as an open-source operating software. This is mainly used for security and its stability makes it a favourable operating system. Linus Torvalds pioneered Linux kernel in 1991.

**Kernel:**

Kernel is an operating system that link applications and computer hardware. Micro kernel, Hybrid, Monolithic are all types of kernels. Kernels control system resources in a machine.

**File permissions**

File permissions forms are central to the security of linux systems.
