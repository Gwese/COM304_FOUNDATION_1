## session 9

The tutor introduced us to the basics of networking. This involves how computers and devices link with each other over the internet. We learned about Internet **Protocols** how it shares data to be used in different datagrams and packets that contain many bytes.

IP has a couple of primary versions namely IPv4 and IPv6. We learned about **hosts,** or **servers,** or **workstations.** We learned that machines have a number of ports called interfaces. A lot of personal computers have a WiFi interface and a wired interface. Upon my research I learnt that a router controls and links multiple networks depending on IP addresses destination. And also computers can function as a router with multiple ports though it is designed for router hardware. It provides features such as firewall security, traffic management, network address translation, dynamic routing and wireless connectivity.

**The application layer**

We learnt that the application layer clarifies data formats which are sent between computers to make certain applications work. These examples include : HyperText Transport Protocol, Secure Shell, File Transfer Protocol and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.

**Session 10**

In this session we were introduced to azure cloud as well as creating an azure cloud account with our student email addresses.

We were also introduced to the history of the internet, morse code, which involved letters as numbers and how messages are relayed between stations.

Our tutor taught us about the DNS-Electronic telephone book.

Personal Computers in the 1980s included home computers. There were phones which had digital lines or analogue .

We also learned that Sir Tim Berners - Lee invented the World Wide Web.

**Reflections:**

Due to missing some early learning lessons, I struggled with Rasberry Pi and its functions. I will look into ways of learning practical lessons in order to gain skills. I am still learning about using GitHub because itâ€™s a new platform and concept for me.
